              "[\"I bought my first HP12C in about 1984 or so, and it served me faithfully until 2002 when I lost it while travelling.  I searched for another one to replace it, but found one difficult to come by in my area.  So, I decided to buy up and purchased an HP 49G.  What a mistake!  I know that many people view the HP 49G (now 49G+) as the flagship of the HP line, but for me that was a disaster.The 49G may be powerful, but using it is extremely counterintuitive...and the manual was sketchy at best.  The 12C, on the other hand, does what I need in a way that makes good sense to me.If you are looking for a solid, reliable calculator, the HP12C may be for you.  It's programmable.  It does basic statistics well, and many business applications too.  The manual makes sense; you will be up and running in short order.I'm ready to set my 49G aside and move back to my old friend.  I didn't even have to replace the batteries in well over a decade of use!HP 12C, I'm coming home!\",\n",
              " 'WHY THIS BELATED REVIEW? I feel very obliged to share my views about this old workhorse, the HP12C GOLD at its 25th anniversary and my 1Oth year as a satisfied ower user and fan. Especially after sharing my frank views on Amazon about two of its three successors on Amazon.com, burying the HP12c Platinum (2004 1st release, HP12cP) and praising the HP12c Platiunum Anniversary Edition (2006 3rd release, HP12cPAE or HP12cPA).To the majority of HP 12c calculator owners and fans, including the non-techkie nerd like myself, the name Hewlett-Packard To the majority of HP 12c calculator owners and fans. The brandname of Hewlett-Packard is synonymous with the highest quality and best range offered in handheld electronic business financial calculators before the first generation of personal computers hits the desktops of business users.To date (December 2007), the bearer of this \"gold\" standard is none other than the HP12C HP\\'s \"golden boy\" in its calculator business segment.The HP12C now a matured product, is the only continuing HP handheld surviving calculator product since \\'81 and probably the longest selling electronic calculator ever. According to HP almost 15 million HP 12Cs, cPs was sold since ,it is probably the best selling HP (and RPN) calculator ever.As a proven product, the HP12C \"gold\" works from day 1, with its form factor and sofware remaining unchanged and has not been dethroned by rivals and even its HP successors which had come and go.Even with PC software versions being sold, the 12C remains the truly indispensable \"portable\" finance-business heldheld computer for its owners, professionals and students alike. This handy companion powers up immediately and is faster than any portable personal computers to jump right into the action.The HP12C is a serious product and the ultimate time tested solution, field tested proven by its users and survived all its rival products, the workhorse moves on.Anyone in charge of this HP line should always bear in mind that the continued production run of the HP 12c is a testimony of HP\\'s quality and standard expected by its customers.Don\\'t just listen to a HP12C fan here, I own and am using three out of 4 models of the HP 12C series, and it is amusing and somewhat disappointing to observe that it had taken HP at least four years and two major upgrades of the HP 12c Platinium, in its futile attempt to \"fix & retire\" the HP12C with three successors in the form of HP12cPlatinum since 2004.It would seems especially frustrating on the part of HP, to realize after all the effort spent on remaking the HP12cPlatinum models that it would not outdone its siblings the HP10bII and HP17bII+ series to seriously challenge the HP12C Gold.  However, by their own rights the HP10Bs and HP17Bs, and the HP12cPlatinum may find their rightful place in the HP financial calculator line, differentiating the HP12C GOLD in terms of price and functions.IMHO, this had happened because the following golden rules were infringed by HP...GOLDEN RULE I - A PRODUCT WHICH STILL SELLS ITSELF IS NEVER OBSOLETE.GOLDEN RULE II - IF IT AREN\\'T BROKEN, DON\\'t FIX IT ! \"The gold rule of thumb should always be guarded as gospel by the HP heldheld calculator product team. Based on the same reasoning, the HP12C\\'s built quality and product standard is paramount to its users.GOLDEN RULE III - ALWAYS LISTEN TO YOUR CUSTOMERS! If in doubt, see rules I & II.GOLDEN RULE IV - ONLY OUTSOURCE THE MANUFACTURING OF YOUR PRODUCT TO SOMEONE WHO COULD BETTER YOUR OWN PRODUCT QUALITY. If in doubt ask IBM about Lenovo.GOLDEN RULE V - THE BENCHMARKING INDUSTRY STANDARD FOR THIS PRODUCT LINE IS THE HP12C. Just in case, if HP does not know or is not listening to its customers.GOLDEN RULE VI - DO NOT DISCONTINUE THE ICONIC HP12C GOLD. HP needs no reminder that the customer is always right. Please let your customer, the ultimate market force decide if the HP12C should ever be retired.As an ardent fan of HP12C and line of financial business & scientific calculators, I am of the view that the day when HP discontinue the HP12C would be the day it exit this business segment. I speculate this would happen when the HP brandname disappears from the 12C just like after IBM name had disappeared from ThinkPads and ThinkCentres.Since the price of GOLD is on the rise, it is indeed puzzling to fans of the HP12C, why HP did not release a genuine HP12C gold 25th anniversary model for the fans to mark the occasion, if replacing the discontinuing the HP12C GOLD is the intention READ ALL GOLDEN RULES above.To be fair, the silver HP12c Platinum Anniversary is very nice and has spotted the \"retro\" silver look of the HP 11C, however, it is still not the GOLD standard. With HP missing this golden opportunity to mark the occasion, I would love to see and own a HP 12C engraved with 50th Anniversary logo, reckon that this would be the ultimate testimony for the HP12C and a milestone for its fans.Looking forward, a GOLD 50th anniversary HP12C Anniversary model would be very nice for the fans.For HP, this is a lucrative business proposition. By now, they would have realized that if they have any of its products which could hit a 50th year home run  in 2031, it would not be from its other product line-it would be this original HP12C GOLD standard bearer. So please treat the old workhorse with the upmost respect!',\n",
              " 'I have an HP 48GX that has been kicking for more than twenty years and an HP 11 that is more than 25 years old and still flawless.  I have had this 12C for about 18 months and the number 5 key is already giving me trouble (have to press hard for it to register).  No drops, no abuse.  The overall feel of this new HP is cheaper plastic.  The keys feel hollow and light.  The available functions are great.  This is a classic calculator.  But the functions are no good if the keys stop working...',\n",
              " \"I've started doing more finance stuff recently and went looking for a good time-value-of-money calculator. I was pleasantly surprised to find the HP12C was still available. I've been using HP calculators for decades (HP-45, HP-15 and now an HP-32SII) because of their great feel and long-lasting quality. However, it's also true that the HP12C is probably the last relic of the great HP calculator legacy. It has 'Made In China' stamped on the rear, but the keyboard feel seems much like my dear departed 15C. Hopefully it will have the same long-term durability.Why do I recommend this calculator?*) RPN. In my world, the purpose of a calculator is to solve fairly straightforward math exercises quickly. If you're a college student and need speed and pictures and parenthesis, buy a graphing calculator. If you're solving Black-Scholl's option equations, fire up Excel or something on your desktop computer. But for straightforward punch-it-in calculator work, nothing beats RPN entry.*) Fit and Finish. The keys have good tactile feedback. The display blinks on every entry. You just *know* you've entered the data correctly. The purpose of a calculator is quick, accurate answers at your fingertips. If you don't care about this, don't waste money on this calculator (or any high-end TI or Casio). Buy a $5 Walmart calculator.*) Straightforward financial calculations. Sure, I could write a program for my HP 32SII to do financial calculations. But why, when I can just key in the data directly to the HP12C, push dedicated financial keys, and get immediate answers. This calculator has most of the financial functions you need in a calculator (amortization, depreciation, NPV, date functions, etc.) along with the basic complement of standard calculator functions (ln, mean, standard deviation, factorial, etc). The complexity level is about right for a calculator. It doesn't take a computer science degree to operate it like the graphing calculators require, and it's far more capable than the $5 Walmart brands.*) Speed. I see reviews complaining that this calculator is slow when doing things like IRR computations. They're right. So what? If your IRR computation is that complicated, use a spreadsheet. If you're a college student taking exams, you're better off with a graphing calculator anyway. For 99% of the things the rest of us do with a calculator the 12C is more than fast enough, and the price of speed is power consumption. My 32SII is going on 10 years without a battery replacement, and I trust the 12C will have the same thrifty ways. It's a pain to need a quick answer, reach for the calculator, and then find the batteries are exhausted. This was a regular occurence when I owned TI and Casio brands. I've never had this problem with the HPs I've owned.It also has some programming capabilities which some may find useful. Personally, I haven't used the programming mode in a calculator for many years. Almost invariably I find it easier to just pull up a spreadsheet or write some code.I suspect the under-30 crowd will find this calculator--maybe the whole calculator premise--feels 'dated', and in a way they're right. However, if you're one of those who, like me, use these tools every day and always want one nearby, I think you'll like this calculator. For fit, finish, and a pleasant balance of performance with simplicity it seems to be on par with my earlier HP calculators. (Time will tell, I suppose, whether or not it has the same durability.) What is certain is that in the age of cellphones, PDAs and computers the era of high-quality long-lasting purpose-built calculators is going the way of the Dodo bird.\",\n",
              " \"For simple calculations and discounted cash flows, this one is still the best.  I used this in my graduate business program, and for years as a practicing CPA and financial executive.  Of course for complex cash flows you will want to use an Excel spreadsheet; but for quick cash flow calculations the HP12C really is the tool you want.Personally I find Reverse Polish Notation (&#34;RPN&#34;), which is what this calculator uses, to be easy and intuitive.  Many do; some don't.  RPN takes the place of brackets in an arithmetical expression and is easy to learn.The hardware on this calculator is superb.  One of these lasted me decades.  It got lost in an office move, so I am purchasing another.  RJB.\",\n",
              " \"While I don't have an MBA, it's hard to believe that a calculator I learned how to use in 1987 during undergraduate business courses is still the standard for the quick calculating financial world. Any finance professional over 30 will know how to use this, and in a pinch, you might need to know how to use it. I know the TI-8x series has financial functions and the graphic capabilities may make those calculators worthwhile. But for most financial pros, if it can't be done on an HP12C, then you probably need a computer.The RPN system isn't hard to learn (at a basic level it works similar to an adding machine), and the functions on this calculator take input and spit out output in a way similar to Excel (i.e. negative numbers for payments and positive for future value, etc.). I found mine the other day after not using it for a while and immediately used it for a discounted cash flow quick analysis I was later planning to do in Excel. It told me the on-the-fly answer I needed.\",\n",
              " \"I've had an HP 12C ever since they were first available, roughly twenty years ago.  I'm just in the process of buying another one, as my original one is finally and completely dead.If you're in any business and have anything to do with money (outside of being a cashier), this calculator is essential.  It includes almost every financial function that you need, and quite a few that you probably don't.  Any problem involving the time value of money or finance is a snap with this mini-machine.The only potential problem that I can see for a new user is the RPN format (By the way, RPN stands for Reverse Polish Notation.  It was invented by a Polish mathematician, Jan Lukasiewicz for symbolic logic.)  RPN is different from the traditional method on entering equations into a calculator, but is easy to learn and use...in fact, once you get used to it, the traditional way seems very clumsy.  For die-hards, the HP 12C Platinum Edition includes both traditional and RPN entry methods and is the one that should be purchased.\",\n",

The display angles up and is legible in even somewhat dim lighting.Seems well-built - better than I expected given the price. Excellent choice if you're looking for a small desktop or hand-held calculator.My only complaint is that you can't clear the memory unless you display it. That seems to be the way with all calculators today.

              " 'Texas Instruments makes an excellent, relatively basic calculator with all the functions I need. The unit is sturdy; this is well made.In addition to solid construction, there are quite a few calculator functions that should suffice unless you need a scientific calculator or another more advanced model. The keys are good sized; and this makes using them to calculate things very easy. You can expect this product to reliably add, subtract, multiply and divide numbers; and you get square root, percentage, a change sign key (to change from a negative number to a positive number), and three memory function keys as well. Great! I also like that the display uses commas when necessary.There are three more function keys at the top of the buttons that read \"(rate, tax+, tax-);\" they are for calculating tax rates.Although this is a solar powered calculator (you can also use it under a light), it can be used with batteries as an option. There is a battery compartment on the back of the calculator but rest assured you don\\'t need to use it; solar power or using this on a desk with a lamp will make a battery unnecessary.Overall, this is an excellent little calculator without the bells and whistles I just don\\'t need.

              " 'This review is for the SECOND version of this calculator, the slightly-larger, grey, BLACK and white model, with a rounded \"mound\" housing the keypad.  I had actually ordered the older model -- the light-grey model, with the blue and white keys, slightly smaller, which I had had previously, but sadly lost.  I had considered returning this newer model, but finally decided against it, as it is now listed as being discontinued by the manufacturer, so -- if I returned the newer one I did get, I very well might have gotten the same model back..........I was, at first, extremely disappointed in the newer model.  (Why both the newer model and the older model -- which look COMPLETELY DIFFERENT -- have the VERY SAME MODEL NUMBER is completely beyond me.  I mean, people who work at Texas Instruments are supposed to be very intelligent and know what they are doing....but why they decided to give to truly different calculators the same model number is something I don\\'t think I\\'ll ever understand.  I mean...what kind of \"genuis\" makes this very simple mistake?  (one who wants to fool online and catalogue buyers, who have to trust that the packers will pack the right model, perhaps>)That said, this NEWER model -- though larger and more-than-slightly bulkier than the older one -- does have a few advantages....I think.I don\\'t remember the older model having a \"tax+\" or \"tax-\" or \"rate\" key, nor do I remember it having a battery backup, as the newer model does.This newer model has a nice little compartment for the battery, which need only be opened with a single screw.  So, the entire back of the calculator need not be taken off -- with the slight dangers, therein, of getting dust into the machine, or disturbing the delicate circuitry, in the half a minute or so, that it takes to change the battery.  With a neat little separate oompartment for the battery changing, the rest of the back of the machine need not be disturbed at all!This is all the more important, as more and more calculators, sadly, are made with \"no user-replaceable batteries\" enclosed, (no -- one is instructed, in these other, still newer calculators, to take them to the nearest authorized repair shop, of the designated manufacturer -- and have them replaced there, like wrist-watch batteries!  First wrist-watches, now calculators!  Talk about planned obsolence!  (Buy even this newer model 1795SV, and keep it close!)Although the newer model 1795sv has a \"wrap-around, windshield\" numberical display, (instead of what is to me, the far more esthetically pleasing and clearer, \"picture-frame\" numberical display, found in the older model 1795sv), the numbers still are well-spaced and clear to view.  It also has the nice, l a r g e numberic display, which is not only on this newer model 1795SV, but also on the older model 1795SV.....and also on the belated, dearly loved, and sadly lost original Texas Instrument \"1795\" model, (no \"sv\"), which I once had, and enjoyed more than both of the \"1795sv\" models put together!  (It was small, handy, and a beautiful medium-bone-yellow in colour.  It also seemed to stay on FOREVER -- pr at least an hour or so, if I remember correctly.  Oh, that Texas Instruments would bring THAT model back, sigh!)Well, this NEW m0del 1795SV -- though NOT the older, handier model 1795SV, nor the original model 1795 -- still has many good points, most of which are delineated above.  It is also a desk-top model which can be carried in a pocket-book, if necessary -- and also in a briefcase, but not in a wallet.  It is bigger than the two previous models in the Texas Instrument 1795 line...but does have that priceless customer-replacable battery chamber.  Although I do prefer the previous two models, this newer one, now available, is not a bad little calculator, all things considered.But I would still welcome, (greatly!), the return of the original 1795 model, and/or the original 1795sv.',\n",

              " \"Main Points:I used this calculator for over 10 years before it finally stopped working, and I treated it fairly roughly (e.g.,coffe spills).  I think others here have attested to the functionality of the TI-30, so I just want to emphasize that it's a tough little gadget as well. Yes, the buttons are on the small side and there is a bit of play, but this was never a major problem (although at times it slows down data entry). You can go to [...] for a good overview of TI calculators, and you can scope out one of TI's major competitors at [...]A Little History:This was also one of the first commercially available low-priced calculators that had two-line display and backspace to correct or edit data entry.  The dual-power and scrolling display features were also once unusual.  The top line (for data entry) shows up to 11 characters; you can scroll backwards or forwards up to 88! The bottom line (shows results) displays up to a 10-digit answer along with a 2-digit exponent.Individual Needs Differ:From the reviews here, it appears that high school math is now more difficult than it once was.  If you know that you're going to need graphing capability, then obviously this is not the choice for you.  Similarly, the prevalence of laptop computers and math/stats software may obviate the need for some of the more advanced features.Recommendation:The layout is very good and, for such a low price, it packs a lot of calculating might.  However, high school (or college)students may want to narrow their choices and then ask their teacher which one has the most relevant functions for the next few years of math. Compared to twenty-five or so years ago, one can now get a lot more calculator for the money. Depending on your budget, therefore, you might determine that a calculator like this is sufficient for your short-term needs, but that you'll need a new one if you go on to more advanced stats and math.  In any event, this is a durable calculator that works very well.\",\n",

However, the calculator is complicated to use, and you almost need a course to learn how to use it.  Furthermore, the functionality is poorly designed and if you press a wrong button the calculator will often freeze on you.At the high price for these TI calculators you would think that they would have gotten all the bugs out.

However, for use in an academic setting, consider that there exists a lot of  teaching materials out there in the classrooms, as well as activities, that are built around this model.

The inputs are easier to enter, without having to memorize long sequences of key strokes.Your instructor and the class activities will most likely dictate which brand and model of calculator to purchase, rather than a reviewer's recommendations.  However, one bit of advice I can give you is very important to remember:  Please, use regular 1.5v alkaline batteries should you purchase this model.  The rechargeable batteries, with their 1.2v, will not be enough to give you a clear display.  A set of four batteries will last a very long time.

Go with a TI-86 or TI-89 as it will serve him/her well through into college. What this means is you save money by purchasing one calculator that will be useful for SATs, GREs, AP tests, high school, algebra, calculus 1-3, college, etc...If you buy a TI-83, you will have to get a TI-86 or TI-89 in the future because a TI-83 is an OVERGLORIFIED TI-82, which is really good for pre-algebra and algebra.GRANTED you can use a TI-83 for Calculus and more advanced math, but it\\'s a good idea to allow your child to grow intellectually by learning how to use a much more advanced calculator for Calc II and III. I had no problems using a TI-86 for Calc 2 and 3, but the TI-89 definitely helped me understand theorems that were in 3 dimensions.For those who are looking for a calculator to use at work:The TI-83 is a piece of junk. It\\'s for kiddies in 6th grade.The TI-86 is a better engineering calc than the TI-89 due to its more intuitive menu interface for units conversions and what not.The TI-89 is better suited for theoretical math work because of its \"pretty print\" and units system. Plus with the right software mods, you can do differentiation/integration with the variables intact - just a time saver really.However I realize you\\'re just trying to find info on the TI-83. My overall recommendation for the TI-83 is: don\\'t bother. It\\'s a solid calculator but pay a bit more and get at least a TI-86. It will serve you WELL into frosh or sophomore year of college (Calculus I-III). A TI-83 will have served its absolute purpose by the start of your senior year in high school.It\\'s like bringing a 9mm pistol in an African Safari. It will handle meerkats and other small creatures but once you get to the larger predators - it will not work very well. The TI-86 and TI-89 is comparable to a .50AE and .50 Magnum.

These calculators can even be used during tests such as the SAT! It gives you a better advantage if you know how to use one of these well. The only downside to these calculators is that they require 4 AAA batteries, they last a pretty long time though because the screen doesn't take up much power. Some people might complain that the screen is too low resolution to today's standards or that it isn't a backlit screen,  but this screen is what allows for greater battery use, you wouldn't want your calculator to power off during an exam.

This time I am in pursuit of my MBA with a concentration in Networking and Telecommunications. Why pursue a boring ole traditional MBA when new technology is to be learned?  So that means math; lots of math; loads of math in the form of algebra, calculus, and the ever dread statistics.Did I mention that I hate math!?  What does one do when one hates math, but still needs to do it in spades?  Buy a calculator of course, but not just any calculator I needed a calculator cable of doing complex mathematics including graphing equations.  My very first course called for a Texas Instruments \"TI-83 Plus Graphing Calculator.\"Powered by (4) AAA-sized batteries (plus 1 CR-1616 or CR 1620 lithium battery for backup), the \"TI-83 Plus Graphing Calculator\" is large unit ideal for advanced mathematics students high school algebra to college-level calculus, and statistics.  The TI-83 Plus packs a lot of mathematical punch and the price of $127.00 (Office Depot.com) certainly confirms it.The TI-83 Plus calculator combines features for statistical analysis, engineering, trigonometric and financial functions making it ideal for a student seeking an MBA.  Financial functions include TVM, cash flows and amortization, though surprisingly a percentage key is missing from the calculator.The two pound (yes, it is heavy, kind of) TI-83 Plus features a non-backlit 64x96 pixel grey scale LCD screen that is frankly hard to read unless the lighting is exactly right.  But the LCD display can display graphs and tables on a full as well as split-screen.  And the display exhibits up to (12) characters and eight lines.  The calculator can graph/trace equations while scrolling through table values.  And the TI-83 Plus can store and analyze up to 10 equations.I also purchased the optional TI-Graph Link (software and USB cable).  The software and cable allows one to connect the TI-83 Plus to a computer via a USB port permitting the transfer of files and data between the two devices.My ThoughtsAmple time should be given to learning what the TI-83 Plus can bring to the table.  All of the nine digits are there of course, but the face of the calculator contains a whole lot more in the form of multi-colored special function buttons; and there are a lot of them!  However, the TI-83 Plus ships with very detailed, instruction manual, so I plan to carry it with me at all times.As I stated above, and it is worth restating, the TI-83 Plus\\'s non-backlit LCD is a little difficult to read when the unit is lying flat on a desk and a lot will depend on the lighting conditions.  Even with the right lighting, the top line of the display is hard to read.Though I was stunned by the high price of the unit the \"Texas Instruments TI-83 Plus Graphing Calculator\" is probably the last calculator you will purchase in your academic career, it is just that powerful.

Avery DesignPro for Mac is a basic graphic design and layout program which includes templates for most Avery products, including Avery/American Greetings Half Fold Blank Cards (3265). This is the easiest way I know of to use this kind of product. In addition, Avery DesignPro includes a printer calibration feature. Absolute precision is not so critical on greeting cards, but if you're printing 90-per-page return address labels, a fraction of an inch one way or the other can run a whole sheet of labels.My printer (an HP 7180) has a duplex (two-sided printing) attachment. The DesignPro software will print both sides on the same job. The trick is to choose Short-edge Binding in the print dialog box. If you choose long-edge, the inside of the card will print upside down on the wrong page. The preview in the print dialog box does not show the inside page, but it does print. If your printer does not have a duplex attachment, then you simply print page 1 only, flip the paper over and then print page 2 only. I'd suggest trying this once or twice with plain paper, so you know exactly how to flip the paper for your particular printer.To me, these products fall in the etiquette scale between  a hand-written note on your personal letterhead and a greeting card you bought in the grocery store.

The paper is sturdier and nicer looking than normal printer paper.  I think at a half page size, they are a little big and the envelopes are a little cheap looking.  My huge recommendation is to always print your card on a piece of normal paper to make sure it is right before using this paper. Since I messed one up, I printed a half page size card. I like that size better, but then you need to have your own envelopes or do without. Making two per page would make the cards more economical, too. It is very easy to find pre-made designs that fit this template size. Even a beginner could make a card in minutes. I used a non-color laser printer and by choosing a black and white design, the cards look great.  Overall, I like these and if they save a trip to the store...I love them.\",\n",
              " \"This Half-Fold  style along with  Avery's Quarter Fold heavy paper stock is the perfect medium to use for those who prefer to send personalized greeting cards.  Sure, you can use standard printer paper, but these scored sheets are whiter, brighter and make the colors and text pop, and it gives your cards ( that you worked long and hard on) that professional look.  These packages all come with matching envelopes which make it a great deal.  I don't  go out and spend $5-6.00 PER CARD for those  generic cards you get at drug stores anymore....... that's ridiculous.  I love designing and personalizing the cards I send out at a fraction of the cost.\",\n",
              " \"I had some less-expensive half-fold cards that I had purchased previously.  I assumed that the same card (same pictures, words and fonts) would look about the same on them both.  After all, they were both Avery products.  To test my theory, I test-printed the same thing (using the same fonts and the same picture) on both cards.  I was amazed at the difference!  The words were sharper and clearer on these cards.  However, where they really stood out was the clarity of the picture!  The picture on the other card was acceptable -- until I put them side-by-side for comparison!  On this card, the colors were more vivid, and the picture was a lot sharper.  In fact, when compared to this card-stock, the picture on the less expensive paper looked faded and washed out (something I probably would've never noticed if I hadn't seen the side-by-side comparison).  I'm still having a hard time believing that different card-stock can make such a diffence.  The difference really is that noticeable.  These more expensive half fold cards are definitely worth the extra expense, and I will buy them in the future.I also like that you can download free templates from [&#8230;] templates (something that is true of all Avery products).  When using Avery's free templates, you have four options:1 - Avery Templates (a simple and basic download, and it works with MS Word & Adobe programs);2 - Avery Wizard for MS Office (a download that gives more options than the basic option and makes MS Word even easier to use);3 - Avery Design & Print Online (Online version that does not require a download, unfortunately I couldn't figure out how to do single labels without printing an entire page of the same label);4 - Avery DesignPro (a download that allows even more features than basic or MS Office templates.

The first time I made greeting cards on a PC, I used HP greeting card paper, which I found on clearance.  I loved making photo cards!  Unfortunately, I realized greeting card paper was a bit costly when not on clearance, so I turned to other paper for my cards.  Mostly, I have made them onCanon Matte Photo Paper, 8.5 x 11 Inches, 50 Sheets (7981A004).  (Note, however, I have not bought this paper since 2005, when I stocked up on it, because it was so cheap.  Thus, I don\\'t know if Canon has changed anything about the paper or not.  The box itself looks different.)  It is basically inexpensive photo paper, and has no Canon name on the reverse side, so you can print your greetings on that side.  (Just make certain you print the photo on the right side.  If not, it will look horrendous, whereas words look just fine.  Hold the paper up to a lamp to find the brightest white side for the photo.)  It also folds relatively easily.  If you want your card on glossy paper, use glossy photo paper for your photograph, pastel or bright bonded paper for your message, and tape or paste the bonded paper to the back of the glossy paper. (All glossy paper I have ever seen has the brand\\'s name on the back, so messages can\\'t be printed there.)  Then, just get a box of envelopes that fit your cards, such asColumbian CO468 Grip-Seal Invitation Envelopes A9, 5-3/4\" x 8-3/4\" - White (Box of 100).If you want it quick and easy, though, do get these Avery greeting cards.  The envelopes are included, and the card paper is already half folded, so there\\'s no struggle in getting the card folded just right.  The photos I printed on these cards looked almost as good as the photos printed on matte photo paper.  I used 10 of these Avery cards to make a stationery set for friends.  I printed photos of their dogs on the front of the cards, and left the insides blank for \"newsy\" notes.  Since the envelopes in this pack come bounded in two sets of ten, that worked out quite well.  I included one of the envelope sets with the cards, and had a very nice Christmas gift for my friends. I don\\'t think the included envelopes are quite as nice as the Columbian ones, but they certainly will do. Also, when making a quarter card, while folding the half card in half, the card tore in half!  So, you might want to watch out for that, or get quarter card paper for your smaller cards.  Making greeting cards on the computer is lots of fun, and Avery makes it simple with these half-fold greeting cards!',\n",

Aside from the typical print-out greeting cards, I use the cardstock for a couple of other things as well: (1) They\\'re scored deeply enough that they rip in half easily. Once ripped in half, I cut along the line to make it look neater, fold each half of cardstock in half, and then make two handmade cards out of one sheet. (2) The cardstock works really well as a cover when creating half-fold booklet projects.One thing that\\'s different about this product from others is that it comes with envelopes. Plenty of other brands only sell cardstock in packs, and this envelope size isn\\'t always easy to find. The printing is also less likely to smear than some other types of heavy paper since the surface isn\\'t glossy.The only negative I have to say is that this packet used to come with 25 cards and envelopes (my old box reads: \"5 more cards! Now with 25 cards.\"). I really wish Avery had kept the pack at a larger size and not taken it back down to 20. The actual product is great, though, and something I use frequently.',\n",

They came out looking so nice and polished.  We didn't even bother with the printer; they just drew right on them.  They will have even more fun when we've got more time to experiment, with glitter, buttons, stickers, cut outs, etc.  I'm looking forward to scanning in some of their favorite drawings and using them for cover art.  Or making a Father's Day card with a photo of the kids and their dad.

TI gets a thumbs up for doing this improvement quietly plus giving a facelift to this already highly regarded value for money business-financial electronic calculator.DID TEXAS INSTRUMENT KILLED SOME BUGS IN THE BA2+?Although I have not yet been able to test the BA2+N, TI may have also incorporated some improvements and killed some bugs on the popular BA2+. It is also probable that some improvements or new functions incorporated on the September 2004 released BA2+ Professional (BA2+PRO) may also have been also incorporated into the specs of BA2+N.I would like to believe that some small but extremely annoying bugs of the \"original\" BA2+ has been quietly fixed on the BA2+N. In particular, I wish to see the \"Reset\" button nuisance which clears all user input formatting on the BA2+ has been done alway with. Most users of BA2+ would know that an accident user soft reset would return to the default Number of Periods per year P/Y to 12, this would upset the results of many TVM calculations when user has set the P/Y to \"1\" to use the calculator in \"number of periods\" instead.BATTERY REPLACEMENT WOES ON THE BA2+I was not able to exam a unit of the BA2+N to see if end users would still need a screw driver to unscrew and pry open the BA2+ casing just to replace the CR2032 battery. It would be nice if TI would incorporate a user accessible slide open battery compartment for the BA2+N or future upgrades of the BA2+.MY RECOMMENDATIONWould be buyers should get hold of the BA2+N or buy the BA2+PRO if you have a bigger budget. Budget conscious users could see that for the price of a BA2+ PRO, a screw driver and spare batteries, new users could afford to purchase for themselves two sets of BA2+N.An advantage of having a spare BA2+N set on hand is that users could free themselves from the trouble of carrying a philips screwdriver and replacement lithium batteries to important assignments or to the examination centre.HOW DIFFERENT DOES THE BA2+N LOOKS?

The first thing I noticed are the keys aren't nearly as good and are kind of annoying to press.  The case isn't very solid at all, I get the feeling if I were to drop it that would be the end of this calculator.

A calculator should do the functions that it is supposed to do, which this calculator does.  However, like several other's have noted, the keys can be a challenge.  I've had to start over after entering a number due to the numbers not enterring as they should have.  A good press of the keys takes care of that issue, but most calculators do not need to have the keys pressed firmly for the correct operation...  If Texas Instruments could redesign around the key issue, this would be a five star calculator, as the case and display are well designed. I have only used this calculator for a total of maybe 15 - 20 hours, and the keys may work better over time, but I have not seen any change during the timeframe noted.Update 6/16/11 - I'm hoping that I ended up with a lemon, and that this is not an indicator of TI's quality standards.  I'm dropping my rating from 4 stars to 2 stars.  The decimal button works only when pressed firmly as do several other buttons on this calculator.  When taking a timed test in a finance class, this calculator really failed me because of these issues.

I'll write back and tell you how it did.NO GLARE MEANS THE PICTURE JUMPS RIGHT OUT AT YOU:What I particularly like about matte pictures is the lack of glare.  You don't have to get the right angle to view it. Also there is almost a 3D effect since you don't see the surface of the paper to make it flat.

If you like glossy photo then this is not the photo paper you would get.  The colors do not jump at you nor have sharp deferential qualities that glossy can produce.  Printing plain texts without color might be too wasteful (costly) for matte paper.  I considered Epson the best in paper qualities over Canon, HP, Kodak and others for the quality/price.

I have printed 8x10s from a 2 megapixel Olympus digital camera, and was pleased with how close it came to 35mm for the price. Since 35mm has considerably more resolution than 2 megapixels, obviously there is a clear difference. However, this printer did a fine job of substituting for the One Hour Photo average picture taking level, and has saved me a ton of money.I also do not recommend generic or refill inks for printers, as I had an HP printer ruined by them. I prefer the separate tanks for each color as well, for the simple fact that they don't make you waste ink. I have gotten over 40 8x10s out of one set of ink tanks, but it varies widely with color saturation and picture content, so I don't think it is possible to give any accurate figures for usage. Another plus for Canon is that the print head is not a part of the ink cartridge, so you don't have to pay to replace that every time you replace ink tanks, unlike some other brands of printers. While there may be some value to that kind of system, Canon's system is less expensive to the user.The ink doesn't seem to dry out very fast with long periods of inactivity, although it is better for the printer to use it regularly. I also like the fact that the low ink warnings give enough time so that one can plan one's usage carefully to maximize what you have left and not run out of a color in the middle of a critical print.\",\n",

If I had a need for one I would not hesitate spending what they are asking for this one. A trick I've learned  is to run the front of the tape gently across your thumb and a dull knife then flip the label over and with a bit more pressure run the tape on the paper side. Like curling ribbon, but not as much pressure. It works like magic. Any stiff, smooth, straight edge will do. If you are in need of one of these I highly recommend this one. I have gone through about 25 tapes, the cutter still works like it is supposed to. I'm not sure how many labels you can get out of a refill but they seem to last forever. I just popped the last one in my machine, so I am replacing my stock. I will only buy 2 this time because they seem to be available.

The keypad is easy to use and the unit has some great features built into it. I like the fact that you can change fonts, or frames  and can print on a variety of colors.  The labels seem to stick much better than the Dymo brand labels we used before.  They adhere to surfaces that I couldn't get cellophane tape to stick to. Almost every office supply or electronic store seems to sell the label cartridges in several colors and sizes.I only have two negative comments about this unit.  First, sometimes it is hard to peel the back off of the label.  You have to try to get your fingernail or similar object between the backing and the label and this is often difficult to do.  Second, it needs SIX AA batteries to run. If you print a lot of labels you're going to be buying a lot of batteries.  I wish that they could have designed it to run off of an AC power source also.Despite these negatives, I think that this is great product.  It works well, is compact, and is reasonably priced.\",\n",

That was almost a year ago, and the labels have stayed in place through countless grubby fingers grabbing at them, as well as countless times I've scrubbed away at the marks those grubby fingers leave.In the kitchen, I didn't stop at labeling cannisters or jars. I labeled drawers, shelves and cupboards, too! Now, neither my husband nor the kids have an excuse to avoid emptying the dishwasher, because they know where everything goes! As in the kids' rooms, the labels have stayed put and held up to repeated cleanings.In the guest room, where the lightswitch operates three separate lights and a ceiling fan, I labeled the switch plate so my guests don't have to waste time flipping switches to find the one they want to turn on or off. Numerous visitors have commented on how helpful this has been, particularly when they're groggy in the morning.Of course, it's been essential in the storage room where clearly-written labels have saved us hours of hunting around in boxes and bins. I even labeled spots on my husband's tool bench. Now when I borrow a pair of pliers or screwdriver he's no longer complaining that I don't return it to the right place.This product is sturdy, too. My 5-year-old has taken a turn printing up labels and yanking out the tape. Although the tape has jammed in there a few times when he's done this (and I'm fairly certain any label-maker's tape would do the same thing), it's been a cinch to get straightened out. It's even survived being dropped on the floor a number of times.I am impressed, and I'm also addicted to this thing.

For the two weeks prior, I have a ton of things that need to be done before T Day, and then each day I check off the things as they are completed.  Never mind Christmas.  You get the idea.

The problem is the tongue of the shoe can get pushed into the shoe, slipping it on this way, and then the fit is wrong.  I've tried to tie the strings to keep the tongue in place, but this had mixed benefits. I decided to try this two-sided tape, and it works great.  I cut about two, one inch pieces, put them on the top of the tongue, and stuck them to the shoe top from within.

For heavier applications, consider using Scotch\\'sexterior mounting tape, which is rated at being able to hold up to five pounds.For best adhesion and performance, really mash the tape in well, smoothing it all over, then apply very firm pressure against the mounted object over each point where you applied tape.

The slight \"sponginess\" to the material, forgives any imperfections in the items to be adhered. Regular tape just leaves gaps.It IS difficult to remove, though. The thickness of the material will often result in removing only a layer of it, so be careful where you mount with it. On the other hand, when things don\\'t stick with regular tape, THIS is what you need.

The foam also gives a little bit of flexibility and shock resistance; for example, mounting something inside a remote control vehicle.  Also, while this is meant as permanent tape, the foam layer can, in some applications, give you a way to pry off whatever you've taped.

              " \"Scotch 1/2 inch Mounting Tape is a padded, double sided tape on a 75 inch roll. One side gets applied to an object, and the other side gets pressed against a surface on which you wish to mount your object. The cushion between the adhesive layers gives you flexibility when it comes to mounting objects that do not lie flat against one another.This mounting tape is designed to be permanent and is not repositionable. The user must take care to line up objects carefully when mounting them, and there is no guarantee that the surface of your walls will be completely immune to damage when this is removed. For some items, it might be helpful to mark its desired position before mounting, or use a small level.For some items, mounting tape is an ideal solution. For example, one of my children made an art project on a 36 square inch ceramic tile. There was no way to nail it to a wall, and adhesive hangers with flaps for mounting on picture hooks don't always hold up to the task. Due to the irregular surface on the back of ceramic tiles, the foam padding is needed to provide the thickness and to allow for irregularities in the surface.As a rule, you should use about a half inch of this tape per ounce of weight. I used 5.5 inches for the ceramic tile, and the bond is as strong as would ever be needed. The package says that it holds up to 2 lbs, which presumably refers to the maximum weight of each object to be mounted. The roll is long enough to support a total of over nine pounds worth of items. Sixty 4 by 6 photographs weigh about nine ounces, so this roll can go a long way.The tape itself comes in a roll with no dispenser and with a single backing strip between layers. Therefore, you can't pre-cut a section and hold onto it for later. But you can cut off the amount you need, apply it to an object, and leave the backing layer in place until you are ready to mount your object.There's nothing new or innovative about this product, but this product is very well suited to its task. It can also be used for a wider variety of tasks, but it might be best to save it for those special tasks for which it outshines other solutions. Although it can replace anything from thumbtacks to picture hooks, thumbtacks are cheaper and this product might be overkill. As double sided padded adhesive tapes go, this one does the job as well as can be expected.\",\n",

Once you put something on the wall with this tape, it is staying on the wall.  It does not remove easily, and thus is not suitable for mounting things you may want to move from time to time (i.e. posters in a child's room, wall calendars, etc.).

Also good to put on the bottom of potluck dishes that get left behind, car key fobs for when you hand the mechanic your keys and on kids toys that go to friends houses with your little ones, just make sure your child is past the stage of trying to chew everything to avoid a choking risk.RATING: A+, highly recommend!\",\n",

Since they are identical (same specs and template number) but one is designed for an inkjet printer (8167) and one is for a laser printer (5267), I\\'ll be posting the same review for both items.These Labels are designed with a \"Pop Up\" Edge.  This means that you bend the sheet at the side and the labels you want literally pop up an exposed edge so you can grab them easily.  Then you fold the sheet flat again.  As with most labels, you can get away with running the sheet through to print only a few labels and then rerunning a partial sheet for a second print of the remaining labels.  In my experience, each subsequent use of a partial sheet runs a greater risk of a jam though.  I\\'m sure Avery\\'s \"jam free guarantee\"  would only apply to a print of a full page.These smaller size labels would also be useful for other applications-such as price tags at a garage sale...I\\'ve never found Avery to be anything but top of the line and this product is no exception.',\n",

It's only useful when labeling large numbers of envelopes at once; but I appreciated the convenience of having all the labels out and ready to go, not having to struggle to dig my nail under each on.My initial impression was that these labels were too small.  They are large enough to fit the average name and address on three lines in Times New Roman 8 point type.  They don't fit a fourth line, even when I tried changing to different typefaces.  If you need four lines, don't buy this.After using the labels, I found the size is actually appealing for my taste.  They are clean and simple and look appropriate on letter and business envelopes.  Larger envelopes or packages may need a more substantial size label.  Companies that want their label to stand out more may also opt for a larger size.\",\n",

The only complaint I have is that I would probably choose a bit larger size... these were a little small.

Furthermore, no labels detached from the sheet while moving through the printer - a disaster which has happened to me using lower quality labels. Yet they are easily peeled from the sheet when it\\'s time to apply them.I strongly recommend that you investigate the \"Design and Print Online\" feature available on Avery\\'s website. It is far more flexible than a simple template and you can save your layout for future use. The interface is a little strange and sometimes behaves in unexpected ways, but you\\'ll easily enough get the hang of it with a bit of experimentation (and it has an \"Undo\"). I printed my first try on plain paper and then overlaid it on the label sheet to double check.I see that several of the reviews here criticize these for being unable to accommodate a 4-line return address. Using Avery\\'s \"Design and Print Online\" you most certainly can create 4-line labels as follows: Find and start \"Design and Print Online\" on Avery\\'s website. Enter the product number (8167) when prompted. Hit Next. Select the design you like (there are many to choose from). Important: select \"Enhanced Editing.\" Hit Next. Select a 7-point font. Important: you want a fine, gracile font like Garamond. Enter the first 3 lines of your address in the text box and hit Return after the 3rd line. The Text Entry box will expand downward to fit a 4th line. Enter your 4th line text. Click outside the text-entry box and then position your cursor over the box and click once so you get the 4-way arrow that lets you move the entire text-entry box. Re-center vertically. You\\'re done. Print and/or Save.Now, a 7-point font is kind of small. Your mail carrier will need his or her reading glasses. If your decision whether or not to purchase these is dependent on being able to do this, then you should try printing some 4-line, 7-point labels on plain paper and using Avery\\'s website to verify that you like the way they look. It might be better to just go for a larger label. The point is, you can do 4 lines in a half inch with these if you want.The package contains 25 sheets of labels with 80 labels per sheet for a total of 2000 labels. If you are an individual rather than a business, that should keep you in labels until the year 2129.These work well and, combined with Avery\\'s website, will allow you to create professional-looking, customized Return Address Labels so you can stop using the cheesy ones that your Insurance Agent sends you every Christmas.',\n",

This means that you bend the sheet at the side and the labels you want literally pop up an exposed edge so you can grab them easily.  Then you fold the sheet flat again.  As with most labels, you can get away with running the sheet through to print only a few labels and then rerunning a partial sheet for a second print of the remaining labels.  In my experience, each subsequent use of a partial sheet runs a greater risk of a jam though.  I\\'m sure Avery\\'s \"jam free guarantee\" would only apply to a print of a full page.These smaller size labels would also be useful for other applications-such as price tags at a garage sale...I\\'ve never found Avery to be anything but top of the line and this product is no exception.',\n",

There is room to write even the most pretentious European address, where they add all kinds of extra lines just to show off that they are in Europe, when we in America, the largest God Given Land Mass in The Continental World Of Its Kind, need just 3 lines.Does it mean we are better than those who live overseas?  Maybe.  And we don't have to talk with those fancy accents either, or in those foreign languages.  What's with them? When did they start with that? Do they think they are too good to speak English? Which is the language used in the Bible, so are they sending a message that way, too? Like to Satan or his mignons????BAnyway that is for each of us to determine in his or her own heart,and we are not here to talk about the snide, red-tinged and possibly devil worshiping Europeans, but about these Avery Labels, so let us return to our subject.  But you must admit, speaking a foreign language AND using more than 3 lines in an adress is just putting it on that one layer too thick.  .Okay, here we are, back to the labels again.  What makes Avery 1/2 X 1 3/4 Laser Printer Labels one notch better than your label (and certainly your inferior European label), what takes them to that semi-mythical Uber-label pantheon, is the stick up edge. You know when you have ten million labels to stick on envelopes and you try bending the page so the labels are easier to pull off,but some bend and some don't, and a couple even bend too far so they get stuck to themselves and you have to sneaky throw them away so no one will see?  Well finally somebody twigged to the need for a bent edge label and here it is.The bent edge does not make sticking labels on envelopes any less miserable, time-consuming and tedious a job, one more suited to, say, the Europeans. Labelling is awful work, particularly when one does it in one's office where one cannot turn the TV set on to watch Judge Judy, but the Avery Labels have that bent edge, a new High Tech Cutting Edge Design Element that makes the job go a little bit faster and every little bit helps.  And if you want to know why, at my age, my job still entails sticking labels on envelopes, it's because Shut Up.\",\n",

I have a few gripes, so I guess I\\'ll stand as the devil\\'s advocate review today, which is rare for me.The labels themselves were of great quality, never jammed or peeled in the printer, and the way you get the labels off of the paper by folding it is ingenious and better than I\\'ve seen elsewhere.  That being said, all I wanted was a simple way to put my return address on the labels.  The issues that I had mostly revolve around the software.1.  The web based printing is simple & easy... it creates PDF\\'s that you download and print.  I had issues getting things to line up though, so I wasted about 50% of the labels on each sheet.  I wasn\\'t being that picky-- as long as everything was on the label, and nothing was on a label from an adjacent label, I considered the label a \"win\"-- even if not centered. Still, I lost about 50% of them.2.  I downloaded the full version of Avery software from the company-- for free! I was happy with that, and expected it to be basic.  But at least at the time of this review, product 5267 was not listed in the software so I couldn\\'t use the software.3.  Take me to the third & final option-- support for Microsoft Word.  I have word 2010 and figured that would be the best bet.  After downloading the Avery software for Office 2010, it wouldn\\'t install... I use Windows 7 64 bit and Office 64 bit, so the software wasn\\'t compatable.So all of that being said, I\\'m glad so many others have had such great success with the labels. I had hoped that the Avery Stand Alone software was going to be the key to success for me as it also supposed print alignment testing, however, the lack of support for this particular label was the final thing to run me off track.I hope some of these \"gotchas\" are helpful to some of you using Windows 7 64 bit or really care about print alignment.I gave it 3 stars because really, even with the label waste on option 1, the ones I did get that were ok enough were good enough to fill my need of return labels.  If I really needed tons of labels and spent more time tweaking and wasting more sheets, there is a good chance I could achieve less waste. And I may try that again.Update! Success! Sort of.... Word 2010 has some built in default label printing functionality and this label is one of the options.

These labels may also be written on by hand when called for which is a useful benefit.  The \"Pop-up Edge\" is a feature which allows you to fold the sheet so one edge lifts, making it easy to peel the label from the sheet.  The center \"margin\" has also been removed to facilitate easier removal compared to earlier products.  I found this \"Pop-up\" to be a double edged sword so to speak as once the labels are \"popped-up,\" I found that they don\\'t quite go back to flat.  The feature is good if you are printing a whole sheet but I sometimes print individual labels which means the popped label is a potential jam in the printer.I found that the Avery labels get the job done which earns them 4 stars.

              " \"Rarely does a company claim something is improved that actually is better, but this is one of those rare occasions.  The simple lack of paper in between the columns of labels does wonders for the ease of peeling off a label.  Why this isn't a common practice for all printable stickers is the real question.  No more bending the paper to peel one off.  On my inkjet printer the printed labels look wonderful as far as colors and clarity.  With the template I was able to customize several mailing labels for different seasons and different addresses.  The labels affix to envelopes easily and I haven't noticed any peeling.  I have only used the labels on regular envelopes, so I don't know how they would hold up on any other type of packaging (such as padded envelopes), but will update if I ever find out.  The labels could have been a little longer to allow for a longer address in larger fonts or a small picture/clip art, but I still was able to put a small jack-o-lantern in front of my friend's address when sending her a Halloween card (only really sent her one so I could use more labels just for fun).  I just had to use a smaller font next to the clip art, but it still is a good size.Word of caution:  Depending on your printer, the printing may be off center or higher on the label than expected.  I'm almost positive this is my printer because I have had this issue with mailing seals as well, but just wanted to advise others to check this before printing many labels.\",\n",

With the normal style of Avery label I tend to pull off the outer grid, then raise each sticker one at a time - this can lead to wrinkled edges that don't stick as well.

Definitely worth getting again and has a nice crisp appearance.

I did use them on that type of envelope, but with the tape applied as well.Updated 6/3/2012 - As these labels have aged they have developed some issues that make me reluctant to leave them with a 5 star rating. the adhesive has gotten less tacky, I now see more of the peeling the other reviewer reported. Equally annoying is a failure of my printer to recognize that these are printable. Because the easy peel has areas near the top that are not covered in label, my printer spits every fifth or sixth sheet out as unprintable. it can take a dozen re-feeds for the printer to stop thinking the page is upside down.

Why not just leave well enough alone and continue with the same style as they started off with so many years ago? Avery doesn\\'t think that way, which is good for us.Avery redesigned the carrier sheet so peeling off the labels is simple as can be.

So, these are great labels, and I can't come up with a single complaint.Second, about the software: I have a Mac, so I didn't try the desktop software. However, on their website they have literally thousands of templates that will work with Microsoft office, and even Apple Pages. Much of it is a bit cheezy, but they have some very plain templates, and you can always edit out the pictures. This makes the labels extremely easy to use, as the templates avoid trial-and-error on placement and margins.All in all, a very nice label solution. One word of caution, however, and this is no fault of Avery and will happen with ANY inkjet product: the ink in inkjets is water soluble. That means if you use these for mail, you really should put transparent packing tape over the label. Probably not worth bothering to do this if you're making return labels, but mail does occasional get wet (neither rain nor sleet nor snow...) and a single drop of water can bleed an address printed on an inkjet.\",\n",

Avery seems to have done everything right with their new Easy Peel labels.  The paper is just the right thickness - blocks out any print underneath without creating a raised edge that gets caught easily.  The glue doesn't lose adhesion over time.  The paper is bright white with a smooth finish and the edges are cut smooth and clean.  Perfect!Plus the new Easy Peel feature makes peeling off a label nearly effortless.  The page is creased under the edge of the label sticker.  Just bend the page and the edge of the label pops up for easy grabbing.  Ingenious design!Number two runner up is 3M brand.  Their paper has a slightly rougher face, but their glue is just as strong.  No Easy Peel technology with 3M labels however.I've learned to stay away from Staples brand labels and the other generic brands.  The glue is worthless and the paper is too thin to cover over any old print.So if you're looking for a great printer label and don't mind spending a little more for quality, Avery brand Easy Peel labels are the way to go.  I've tried 5 different Avery Easy Peel styles and all are top notch.\",\n",

              " \"Our town's energy committee recently had a project for which we needed about 250 peel-off labels.  Our plan was to distribute 250 CFL (compact fluorescent) light bulbs free at our town's community day (sort of like a street fair) in order to encourage people to use the bulbs to reduce electricity use.  CFL light bulbs can save about 75 percent on electricity over incandescent bulbs.  For the 250 bulbs, we calculated that for 8000 hours of use and an electric cost of $0.10/KWh the total savings vs. 100 watt incandescent bulbs for all the bulbs would be about $15,000.  There would also be a saving of 94 tons of carbon dioxide emission.Avery Address Labelswere a good choice for adding a label indicating the savings for using the bulbs and our committee's name.  The question was how to get the information printed on the labels.  At the Avery web site, I found free software, DesignPro, which makes it possible to produce label designs for different label sizes.  I downloaded the software easily and got started on the designFor laser printer labels, there were fourteen pre-made templates for the different size labels.  I chose the template that matched my labels.  Using DesignPro was a little like using PowerPoint.  I was able to cut and paste a graphics image, add the appropriate text, and choose a font for the text.  A test run on my color laser printer produced a beautiful matrix of labels.  The only problem was to find out which side of the label stock had to be up.  I can never remember.  After an up/down test, I had my sheets of labels printed in no time.Our community day give-away was a big success.  Our free light bulbs lasted about four hours.  We had enough time to peel and apply the labels as we gave away the CFLs.  One surprise is that we had to have a sales pitch even for give-aways.  The other surprise was that many people had never seen CFLs before.  I am now a big fan of Avery labels, but I recommend getting the free software to make them work.\",\n",

Tell it what label sheet you have (8160 in this case) and it will help you create a design and fill in the information to print and then pop up a webpage and fire up a print job.  It was as easy as could be.  No download, no messing with Word or Adobe, just a website to visit.I did a test sheet on regular paper but it was right on the first try.I see another reviewer complained about the stickiness.  I put a couple labels on a sheet of paper, pressed them firmly and let them sit for a minute and tried peeling them off.  I had to pick at the edges to get it started but then it peeled off without much tearing of the paper underneath, so I have to agree that the glue could stand to be stronger.

First, getting your ink jet to align with the labels is hard because there is no flexibility.  A slight feed error and the printing overflows on the next label, and the whole set of 30 labels must be thrown out.  Second, even when you get these lined up perfectly, the label is very small.  You can get three lines only- squeezing four lines requires type that is too small, or lines that are too closely spaced.  I gave this 4 stars because the labels are well made and work as advertised.  I took one star off because the labels are too small, and I do not understand why they would suggest these are good for address labels-  they are simply too small for most applications, and simply too small to line up properly on a printer.  The templates are fine.  But my epson printer grabs them with a slight shift each time.In all other aspects, these are excellent ink jet labels.

I have OpenOffice.org and it found the size easily.  On the back of each sheet, there are instructions telling how to download the Avery Wizard for Microsoft Office.  It also talks about their templates available on their website, however I've never needed to use any; I just use the ones in the word processor.You'll pay a little more for them than the generics, obviously, but it's not much more and it's worth it.  With the cheap ones if you put the label down a little crooked, it sets immediately and you tear apart the envelope and label trying to move it.  These are a little more forgiving and can be adjusted somewhat.  That's a good feature for me.  It's also handy how easy the labels are to tear off.  They don't have the usual paper around the labels.  It's open so you can more easily pull them away from the sheet.The label paper is good quality.  They're for an ink jet printer and the ink didn't run at all when I used them.  The sheets went through the printer smoothly with no issues.

I suppose this helps prevent jamming in laser printers, but I never experienced jamming with the 8160 nor 5260 labels.I have switched to laser printing exclusively because the cost per page is so much lower with the lasers printers and the ink never smudges once it leaves the fuser.The bottom line on this is, I will probably continue buying the Avery 5260 labels.',\n",

These one-inch high labels easily accommodate a three-line address. A four-line address fits. However, if you want to take full advantage of your word processor\\'s capabilities and add a zip bar code line (which really DOES work in getting your mail delivered faster), you can fit it in on the three-line address, but it gets cut off on the four-line address.If you have a longer address structure, you\\'re absolutely doomed. For example: I have several unmarried couples on my list. They each require a line. (Mr. John Smith, Ms. Mary Jones). I also mail some company executives, and this becomes a nightmare:Mr. John Smith, PresidentThe ACME Company1234 Main Street, Suite 5City, State, Zip//////bar code////////.This address does not fit on a 1\" label.This makes creating a large mailing a real problem. I print the whole list (800+) in this label, then discard the ones that didn\\'t fit and re-do them manually on label #05163, which are the next size up but, at 2\" x 4\" they are really to BIG. (#5962 which is 1 1/3\" high doesn\\'t provide that much of an improvement and it\\'s still 4\" wide!)Please, Avery, make a 1.5\" x 3\" label to accommodate the longest names and titles and the longest addresses and not look horrible on the envelope--and make them Easy Peel, just like this one.',\n",

I like that the labels are not side by side connected together like some labels I have used in the past but the labels have spaces between them (side by side) so they come off easy. The labels are close together on top and bottom but they don't stick together. Has anyone used labels like I had where the labels hang together or stick to the paper when peeled off? Ugh, I hate that. This one will not do that.I also like that it came with four free samples of Avery Note Tabs that was a pleasant bonus. Another great feature Avery has is free templates online for Microsoft Word and an Avery Design and Print. Going online, I found 44 templates listed for the file folder labels but about a handful of templates that will work with these specific file labels. They are basic but get the job done and look good printed out. Another freebie is the Avery Wizard for Microsoft Word for more creating. I use Wordperfect X5 and the templates work fine in it. I have yet to explore the other software listed but I just thought it was a great added bonus for using their templates.

The operator I spoke with and her supervisor both assured me that all Avery products are made in the U.S.A. in Brea, California, but some of the raw materials may be from other countries. They were unable to route me to anyone in Brea to confirm this information. After examining the packaging I have I found a sticker that said \"Made in Mexico.\" Other Avery products I have say either Mexico or China. None say U.S.A.I am very hesitant to use or recommend Avery products since there are very few US jobs associated with their products.**************************************************My initial review of the product was good prior to my call to the \"Consumer Service Center\" in Manilla:I have used sharpie pens on all my well-used file folders and decided to try these file folder labels by Avery. I was surprised how well they blocked out the old hand-written tabs with clean new labels. The TrueBlock Technology is simply a silver backing on the sticky side of the label.As for the templates, I downloaded the Avery 8366 template for MS-Word on Avery\\'s website, but was disappointed that I could not get the text to center on the label when I increased the text to a legible size. So, I downloaded the Avery Wizard 4.0. It took some time to download and install, but well worth the time. The wizard was easier to use than the template. It comes with a few colorful graphics to make your labels interesting. I was able to use a big text size and center the text vertically and horizontally.Once I had my labels printed out, it was easy to peel and place the labels right in the file drawers, and I had a whole file drawer of easy-to-read folder tabs.A couple side notes. 1) Avery required that you give them your name and email for downloading a simple template which I didn\\'t like. In addition during the Avery Wizard 4.0 install there is a box automatically checked to also install the Avery \"Ask\" toolbar and make it your default search engine. You can easily uncheck it, but rather tricky of Avery to set as the default to install additional software on your computer. 2) If you try and remove the label on your file folders, they do not easily release and you\\'ll peel off some of your file folder with the label.Again, this may be a useful product, but very disappointing that Avery continues to outsource all their customer support and manufacturing!',\n",

I've used various software programs for printing these labels and they always come out looking great, plus a single sheet doesn't seem to be affected by the heat from the laser printer and even after many trips through, the labels still release cleanly, then stick well to the intended surface.  Even better, they can be removed cleanly when no longer needed.I use them for file folders as intended, but also for jars of stored goods in the kitchen.  These may be multiple jars of the same thing, e.g. jelly, or one jar of a newly ground spice.  I've given up thinking I'll remember what's in all those little spice jars.  There's plenty of room on these labels for the name of the contents and the date.I don't always use the printer.  I keep a sheet of the labels in the kitchen for quick labeling and just write on them with a pen or marker.  When I reuse the jar, the labels peel off in one piece and don't leave an annoying residue.My latest labor saver is to write the name of a device on one end of the label and fold it in half over the cable that device uses so there's no more guessing which cable goes to the scanner and which to the camera, etc. etc.  That worked so well, I labeled all my stored chargers so I now know which is which and don't have to try multiple plugs to get a fit.  Some things don't need charging often enough for me to remember which of the dozen little corded black boxes is the right one. I've seen tags you can buy for this purpose, but why spend the money when these labels work so well. In addition, if the cord is much longer than it needs to be I include several loops when I fold the label over it, effectively shortening it to a more manageable length.Now I'm beginning to label various items in my home discretely on the bottom or back to aid my kids when they inherit it all.  My daughter suggested it since she feared she wouldn't remember the details and dates of Great Uncle Sam's baby cup and like items.  Because the labels stick well, but release cleanly they seemed a good choice for this labeling.  If they are too big, I cut them in half.  With the printer you can get a lot of info on the label.I'm really pleased with this size and the quality and will re-buy.  Highly recommended for multiple uses.\",\n",

Like most other reviewers I tend to try to use and reuse file folders and have at one time or another resorted to writing over labels with magic markers or sharpies or sticking labels over others to the extent that the folder looks, well less than professional.While I do not use the labels in my printer these come with free software online and templates that are easy to use.An added bonus is the generous Box Tops for Education coupons on each package. Since we have teachers in the family and grandchildren in school we are aware of the amount of money your school can earn by saving these coupons.

Avery now has the added feature of being able to design the labels directly from their website and print (Go to their website, and then click on \"Design & Print.\"  Avery is truly going the extra mile to make the process of printing labels as simple as possible.I\\'ve been using Avery labels for years, and they continue to improve upon their already excelent products.

For those of you that want to re-use old folders, and completely mask the previous label/marking, this label does the trick.  After printing out a sheet of labels, I placed them over folders with permanent markers markings, old printed labels, pens, and more.  On regular labels, you may be able to see faint outlines of what was written before.  With these labels, I was unable to detect any previous marking.  Works as advertised!There are 25 sheets of labels, each with 30 labels, for a total of 750 labels.  Whether you print or write directly on these file folder labels, what amounts to less than 3 cents per label, you can\\'t go wrong with this.  Unlike some of their other labels, this particular one worked well with my Epson Photosmart printer as well as my ancient HP LaserJet 8150 (If your printer has the option to, be sure to specify that you are printing on a label versus a regular sheet of paper).Needless to say, I highly recommend this product.',\n",

Labels have become the preferred choice for me and that is where these improved Avery ones with their super opaque cover technology shine.Avery labels are simply the best brand you can buy.  A label isn\\'t something that cannot be improved upon and Avery continues to be the leader in the finish of the actual label, the adhesives, and their \"TrueBlock Technology\" which makes the label 100% opaque to anything under it.  No more \"x-ray\" vision of the previous writing, or previous label, underneath makes for a neat job of folder presentation.  They feed flawlessly through all my printers, and if only printing a single the sheets will hold up extremely well for repeated trips through.  The quality is top-notch and you can use a fine point sharpie to write on and it is still crisp without the fattened bleed look to your written labels.

I\\'ve used them as labels on so many different items that I am addicted to having these on hand.  You can use them not just in the office, but for lots of creative labeling.  You can label audio/video cables by wrapping them around the cable, price sundry items if you have a business, label dates on items stored in your fridge or freezer, put a date you opened something such as olive oil so you know it is still usable, the list goes on.  They stick and they remain readable under  and/or heavy use conditions.  These labels are worth the money and you may find yourself addicted too.  Recommended with no reservations.',\n",

I use them regularly at work for their intended purpose, and I also use them at home to label stuff going into the freezer. They do stay on even when frozen, but are easiest to remove while still frozen. If they get wet before I try to remove the label, some adhesive has to be scrubbed off.I doubt Avery matters for the freezer application, but if you want a professional result for more traditional uses, Avery and name brand printer toner are a must.I've tried several different generic brands -- from all three big office retailers -- and the letters get smeared or flake off when applying the labels. Add generic toner, and the problem gets so bad that the printing becomes almost illegible. With generic toner these smear a little bit, but with the name brand toner (I've used these in both HPs and Canons), there's no problem. The generic labels might seem a lot cheaper, but these are well worth the extra dough.As far as True Block goes, well, I don't really care, but it does work. The labels have an opaque backing between the paper and adhesive, which doesn't allow anything below it to show through. I usually just remove the label if I'm going to re-use a file folder, because I'm just going to covering up the damaged area with another label anyway. True Block seems more useful for shipping applications than for file folders. I don't know whether or not Avery is selling these labels in a non-True Block form, but if so, it may be worth looking closely at price.\",\n",

There were no problems with the label sheet feeding through the printer. The labels hold the ink without smearing or blurring or bleeding. Furthermore, no labels detached from the sheet while moving through the printer - a disaster which has happened to me using lower quality labels. Yet they are easily peeled from the sheet when it\\'s time to apply them. Used over an existing label or writing, they are truly opaque. Nothing shows through.About half my files are 1/3 cut Manila folders and the other half are 1/5 cut Pendaflex hanging folders. These labels are intended for the 1/3 cut folders and they work perfectly there. But I found that by restricting the text on the label to about 2 inches total width, I could easily use them on the 1/5 cut hanging folders as well. I just applied the new label to the old paper label insert and then folded over the excess.I recommend that you investigate the \"Design and Print Online\" feature available on Avery\\'s website. It is far more flexible than a simple template. With it, I was able to create a text field for my labels that was short enough to fit on the 1/5 cut folders. You can select fonts, sizes, colors, styles, even add images to your labels. And you can save your layout for future use. The interface is a little strange and sometimes behaves in unexpected ways, but you\\'ll easily enough get the hang of it with a bit of experimentation (and it has an \"Undo\").

The packaging Avery sells their labels in works great for storing them because it keeps the labels from bending or getting the corners torn up, yet is super easy to take a new sheet out or put one away for future use...without taking up a bunch of space.  The label is the perfect height for the tabs on hanging file folders, but it a bit too long, so I just fold it over the back and it works perfectly.  My filing cabinet now shows my OCD nature and is freakishly neat & organized thanks to Avery!  My only gripe, and this is a rather pathetic one...I wish they came in colors to match my folders...I'd even settle on just plain manila.  Then my filing cabinet would be a true work of art!!\",\n",

As warmth from a printer or copier heat up the glue on the labels, a sheet can only be run a certain number of times before there are runner marks on the label and the adhesive starts to denature from heat, affecting stickiness and colour (yellowing).

My definition of \"Clear\" is, whether the envelope is pure white or colored, you should be able to apply this label and unless you catch the address at just the right angle, you may or may not see a glossiness where the label has been affixed.Why is this such an important point??  Well, we used these labels for our wedding invitations and RSVP cards.  We spent top-dollar on some premium cream-white envelopes and expecting the label to mostly vanish since it was clear, it did not.  It leaves a \"clear-frosted\" solid-rectangle of the entire label.  I\\'ve seen other types of \"super-clear\" labels and you can barely see the edge of the label and the rest of the \"truly transparent\" label simply vanishes, except for the printed address.  These exact labels are not like that, they are not truly transparent.  We felt the appearance \"cheapend\" our hard work on the invitations and premium envelopes we purchased.  We felt it was somewhat false advertising for the \\'clear\\' part.Also on the easy peel part, these labels were no easier to unpeel than any others we\\'ve used, in fact, all of the constant \"easy peeling\" somewhat crinkles the rest of the labels.  The description for this product says, \"... bend the sheet to expose the trademarked Pop-up Edge for fast peeling and fold the sheet back to flat\" - yea, do this 20 times and you\\'ll no doubt have crinkles in your other labels.  So I somewhat disagree with the \"easy peel\" marketing.###So my rating of 3 stars is for my comments above, the rest of my review is to help out fellow Amazon-ers and is NOT related to the 3 stars above:########################Note: if you are using these with standard white envelopes, yes you\\'ll be fine, just be forewarned if you use non-white envelopes.I did ruin 2 sheets because they misfed, even though they were perfectly aligned in the paper tray, so I\\'m not blaming Avery, as it could have been the printer\\'s paper-feed mechanism.  To save you from ruining a sheet, I found the best way is to select Manual Feed and print only ONE sheet at a time; do not load multiple sheets as they could get misfed.  Once we loaded one sheet at a time, we were fine.  I was careful not to force the paper into the paper-feed, rather, allow the printer to gently pull the individual page of labels.I did use the 8660 code inside of Microsoft Word and the template of labels was a perfect fit when printed (and when I fed the labels correctly).',\n",

              " \"Our town's energy committee recently had a project for which we needed about 250 peel-off labels.  Our plan was to distribute 250 CFL (compact fluorescent) light bulbs free at our town's community day (sort of like a street fair) in order to encourage people to use the bulbs to reduce electricity use.  CFL light bulbs can save about 75 percent on electricity over incandescent bulbs.  For the 250 bulbs, we calculated that for 8000 hours of use and an electric cost of $0.10/KWh the total savings vs. 100 watt incandescent bulbs for all the bulbs would be about $15,000.  There would also be a saving of 94 tons of carbon dioxide emission.Avery Address Labels were a good choice for adding a label indicating the savings for using the bulbs and our committee's name.  The question was how to get the information printed on the labels.  At the Avery web site, I found free software, DesignPro, which makes it possible to produce label designs for different label sizes.  I downloaded the software easily and got started on the designFor the labels, there were about a dozen pre-made templates for the different size labels.  I chose the template that matched my labels.  Using DesignPro was a little like using PowerPoint.  I was able to cut and paste a graphics image, add the appropriate text, and choose a font for the text.  A test run on my printer produced a beautiful matrix of labels.  The only problem was to find out which side of the label stock had to be up.  I can never remember.  After an up/down test, I had my sheets of labels printed in no time.Our community day give-away was a big success.  Our free light bulbs lasted about four hours.  We were able to peel the labels from the printed sheets easily. There was enough time to peel and apply the labels as we gave away the CFLs.  One surprise is that we had to have a sales pitch even for give-aways.  The other surprise was that many people had never seen CFLs before.  I am now a big fan of Avery labels, but I recommend getting the free software to make them work.\",\n",

Since I use Office Products, I used the Word template.I found the template to be easy to use and was able to export my mailing list so that I could print my labels with no issue.  The nice part about these labels is that they essentially disappear onto the envelope that you are using so only the printing really shows up.  This makes it look as if you had inserted the envelope into a typewritter (anyone out there besides me remember those?) and printed out the address.The only caution I have has to do with inkjet printers in general and that is to be careful about getting your label wet as the print will run.  My early solution to this problem was to put a piece of clear shipping tape over the label.  My current method of dealing with this is to use a Kodak Printer as their ink will not run or smear when it gets wet.I gave this product a 4 star instead of 5 star as I still find the labels difficult to remove from the sheet if you only print one or two labels.  While bending the page works to release a label, it also generally loosens the adjoining label.

I use them multiple ways: there's always the address label for the few snail mail pieces I still send, then there are file folders for the actual paperwork I still file manually, instead of digitally, but it's the other stuff where I really put these to use - they're perfect for labeling Mason jars after you've processed that summer harvest of peaches and figs, I've used them to label bakery boxes of cookies I've baked and taken to meetings (I have a set pre-printed with the names and ingredients of various cookie recipes I bake frequently), they're a snap to slap on a jar or Tupperware container filled with arborio rice you'd like to distinguish from the basmati in the container next to it on the shelf and they make figuring out which computer cable goes to which peripheral a snap.These clear labels are even better than the white ones.  They're advertised as clear - don't expect shiny-clear, like a piece of cellophane tape.  Instead, they've got somewhat of a mildly-milky matte finish, like Scotch brand Magic Tape, that doesn't exactly disappear when applied to surfaces.  That's hardly a negative, however, as they stick much better than the white ones - I'll be using these from now on for Mason jars and other goodies in the pantry.  These also seem sturdier...I expect they'll stand up to wear better than the white paper-based labels.Finally, Avery has done a nifty little improvement to the base papers these labels are mounted on: just a small bend in the paper causes the edge of the label to pop up and makes removing them a snap!  You can easily extract a single label without bothering any of the others.Against truly dark items (do you really mail things in black envelopes all that often?) with dark printing on the label may be the only time you'll need to use a paper-based label instead; the contrast in that situation may simply not be enough to read the label easily.With that one exception, I expect I'll be using these labels often and to good effect.

I highly recommend the Epson Photo papers as they are designed for the Epson inks and the Epson printers specifically. I tested the \"Epson Premium Photo Paper Glossy\" and \"Epson Ultra Premium Photo Paper Glossy\" and recommend both. Looking at the same image side by side on the two papers the differences are almost imperceptible. The detail and color are identical under the most careful scrutiny. A few differences emerge under very careful observation:* The Ultra Premium Paper is slightly heavier paper, this adds to its stiffness. When picking up a 4x6\" photo from the 4\" edge there is about half as much bend vs the Premium Paper.* The Ultra Premium Paper has an ISO brightness of 96, versus 92 for the Premium Paper. This makes no difference in color rich areas of photos but in light highlights if you stare long enough you can convince yourself they are brighter in the Ultra Premium. Telling the difference in brightness requires good light, identical photos side by side, and far too much scrutiny.* The Premium costs about 12.7 cents per 4x6 sheet in packs of 100* The Ultra Premium costs about 22.7 cents per 4x6 sheet in packs of 100Given the quality differences are almost imperceptible and the price difference is almost double I\\'d recommend the Premium for every day use and the Ultra Premium only if you are entering a photo contest or have money burning a hole in your pocket.

              " '.This review is of the AT&T; Trimline model 210, made by Advanced American Telephone under license from AT&T.;  Along with similarly-shaped \"Trimstyle\" and other imitator models, there are readily available  two other, similar phones entitled to use the term \"Trimline\":  one marketed by Northwestern Bell (which sells a  lot of corded phones); the other the model 205 Trimline, as one expects a bit simpler than the model at hand.  The model  210 Trimline has a long history of production at different sites, with few pauses from the mid-1960s to the present.  During the early days of renting the phone from Ma Bell they were made in Indiana  (rotary models, too); then (according to Wikipedia) tone models came out of Singapore, the Philippines, Mexico, China and again China.  I think the advantages definitely outweigh the disadvantages of owning a newly made model 210, and I\\'ll elaborate:PROS:  Fully modular:  not only the handset but the line cord is modular, including lead into the telephone base itself (prior reviewers did not find that feature) .  This makes extending the line cord a breeze, substituting  either a very long male/male phone cord, or inserting a modular (F/F) adapter in the middle of two conjoined male/male cords.  I\\'ve tried that and found fit-and-finish were fine with GE brand coupler from the \"Also bought\" recommendations at this site.A little heavier than some previous \"retro\" Trimlines, but of course not nearly so heavy as the originals of the Sixties and Seventies;Receiver volume can be raised or lowered via  switch on the outside of the handset;Inside the phone below the number pad are found an OFF-LO-HI  volume switch (note that it is possible to turn the ringer off entirely, although some earlier reviews have said the contrary).  Chirper is a moderate, office-style pitch, nothing extraordinary;Can hold (if the specs are right) up to 13 stored numbers, although that may really mean ten stored numbers plus the three feature buttons for Fire, Police and Ambulance;It can indeed mount on a wall--just follow instructions.Small footprint and an acknowledged \"classic\" design, down to the rounded rectangular buttons on the handset.  Lack of ringer bell notwithstanding, this is probably the Trimline design and touchpad layout that best mimics the Bell (Western Electric) Trimlines of 40 years ago.Switchable Tone/Pulse on handset should anyone still need to imitate rotary-dial \"pulls\" with Pulse;Surprisingly cheap.  This model retails at thirty-two .95 (and you can expect to see it a great deal cheaper here)  Accessories are cheap, but color issues may arise (see below)..CONS:  No one really knows how long this particulate incarnation is going to last under ordinary residential use..  Some prior reviewers had their Trimlines fail almost immediately; others have kept this same model no. for ten years and more;Handset has buttons for \"Flash\", \"Redial\" and \"Mem[ory],\" but not a dedicated \"Hold\" button per se;This is not a two-line phone; even the cheapest of them cost more;The \"lit\" handset is indeed so dimly lit as to be practically useless.  At least no separate AC connection is required.There is nothing remotely domestic (USA/Can) about 210\\'s current manufacturing site, China;The coiled handset cord provided is short (a loop of about 32 inches stretched but not overstressed; i.e. about 1.4 feet per side); and . . .Finding  a new longer coiled handset cord, while easy as to function with so many suppliers around, has proved to be a real BEAR when it comes to matching colors!  This AT&T; white is more of an off-white, not the Polar white of GE/RCA white phone accessories, nor anyone else\\'s ivory, ash, or beige that I can determine.  Technically \"off-white\" as a color still exists in the canon of AT&T; accessories, but.... please let me know if you find any.And speaking of which, despite a need, product instructions lack any attempt to sell accessories like phone cords by mail or web.SUMMARY:  If you want a corded phone with a small footprint for light use that weighs a little more than was strictly necessary,  the current 210 should serve.  But if you want only one \"main\" corded phone for the living room, kitchen or office, there are plenty more choices out there.  For about twice the money you can get a speakerphone white model out of Northwestern Bell and other Bell competitors and survivors; with not only speakerphone but  more memory, usually a dedicated `Hold\\' button . . .  and at the higher price ranges genuine TWO-line phones make their appearance!  (This may beg the question of why a second corded line is needed, but there are home/office situations where that\\'s for the best.)Whether your backup is a rarely used cell phone prone to battery depletion, or a traditional corded phone like the Trimline 210, test it every now and then.  No one wants to come across failure during a real emergency situation.Along with its Brady Bunch-era  charm, the Trimline 210 is a recognized design classic.  If you find it a little too bland and you want to make a stronger nostalgia statement, repro-retro Princess phones are not hard to find.  To buy American, some residential phones out of Cortelco that were  manufactured in the USA can still be found.  Good luck whatever your decision, and if any of you know how to find accessories (peripherals) like an AT&T; coiled handset cord in their signature off-white version of white, kindly \"Comment\" here to that effect!  Thanks.',\n",

              " \"August 2012. I purchased two of these phones to wall mount in my basement and garage. They work - meaning they ring - but I get complaints about voice quality on every call. Cost was $9.00 each with free shipping (assuming the order totaled at least $25.00)Despite some remarks that these phones can not be wall mounted, those statements are simply NOT true. I have two of these phones, both of which are currently wall mounted. As noted in the instructions, you must reverse a clip on the base unit for wall mounting. That clip then provides a tab/hook that keeps the phone firmly in place on the base unit. This type of arrangement is essentially universal to all phones that I've ever seen that can be both used horizontally or vertically. To switch the tab from horizontal to vertical mounting took less than 5 seconds.Another bit of confusion. A few reviewers state that the cord from the base to phone is hard wired and can not be replaced with a longer one. That is not true, at least in 2012. The cord has standard clips on both ends and can be replaced at will.Yet despite that mis-information - I'm VERY disappointed with the voice quality. Every time I answer these phones people complain (unsolicited) about the voice quality. A hard wired phone (as opposed to a cordless) should sound great but clearly these phones don't! Your only real option for a better hard wired phone would be a Panasonic, at about $30.00.\",\n",

I've compared several other trimline phones and this is the closest phone I could find to the original Bell phones.Northwestern Bell also makes a trimline phone, but the quality and comfort are nowhere near this AT&T; version.If you read the other reviews, you will see that at least one review (dated November of 2004) says that this phone was discontinued.

Besides, the fact that this is corded means you\\'ll never misplace the cordless handset!The phone has back lit buttons which are desirable for those of us who are elderly or in any way sight impaired. The buttons could be brighter but the back lighting does improve upon no lighting. The phone offers well known features including \"last number redial,\" too. The phone has a mute feature, adjustable ringer volume and more. These functions never disappoint me. It also has a small knob that lets you switch between touch tone and pulse (rotary) dialing. I use touch tone dialing as most people do. I am particularly impressed that a phone in this price range even has a twelve number memory feature for speed dialing. Cool! However, as another reviewer correctly notes, when you program the phone to remember frequently dialed numbers, you need to actually dial the number--so hang up fast if you don\\'t intend to speak with that person at just that moment! I don\\'t care for that so I will take off one star for this.If you want to take a nap without the phone ringing, just turn the ringer off by using the knob at the base of the phone.

The trimline is just that.Decently made (though sadly not in the USA--no corded telephones are made in the US any more) with just enough extras which include a lighted keypad, a mute button which allows you to hear your caller but prevents them from hearing you, Flash which allows easy access to Call Waiting (if you subscribe to this service) and Redial which redials the last number called.Setup was a snap (two phones installed as wall phones, two as table models) and all phones now have the speed dial numbers stored for quick access. Simple and efficient, and very affordable.\",\n",

That can't be done with this tape; once it's stuck, it's stuck.The one thing I didn't like about the tape is that it was somewhat hard to tear off the roll.  This isn't a big deal; it's not like trying to tear, say, adhesive tape, but it often took a couple stabs before the edge of the tape hit the cutter edge just right so the piece of tape would tear off.  This fumbling occasionally caused the tape to reel out too far, or to contact the gift wrap before the tape was torn off the roll (picture holding down gift wrap and tape roll with one hand, pulling tape and tearing with the other), and of course once it encountered the gift wrap, too bad if it wasn't in the right spot.  No peeling it off.If this product and the old standby, Scotch Magic Tape, were available at the same price, I would probably buy this one for gift wrapping since the matte finish and secure sticking were nice on the gifts.  However, if it was priced higher, I'd probably stick with Magic Tape, since it disappears and sticks nearly as well, and it doesn't have the tough-to-tear issues.\",\n",

Though that tape also does a great job when used for wrapping, the Satin Finish tape is better.The only problem I had is that I was really surprised at how little tape came on each of these three rolls; it was ridiculous.  I had a \"regular\" single roll of Scotch Satin Tape and the tape on THAT roll was at LEAST three times the diameter of the tape on each of these 3-pack rolls.  So, the bottom line is that these three rolls of tape seem to have less tape than a single roll of the regular sized Scotch Satin Tape.  Basically if you like to have more rolls of tape lying around (for example, useful if other people are helping you wrap) AND the three rolls are cheaper, together, than a single roll, then go for the three rolls.  If, however, you like having less clutter, less wasting of resources (more plastic going into the garbage), and NOT running out of tape in the middle of wrapping, go for the single roll.  (The single roll also has the advantage of having a stronger case -and is sealed on both the front and the back.You can\\'t go wrong with the quality of this product, just with the amount of waste, and the amount of tape you get for your money.Recommended as a single roll.

I taped every single little thing to see how it would look afterwards and to see how durable it felt.  I was completely impressed!  I seriously couldn't see where I had taped and it felt really strong. And the book looked and felt 100 times better than the books that I used regular tape on. It is also important to note that the tape feels really silky and soft and it it difficult to feel where the edges are.  I'm not sure how they did that, but I love it!

The flimsy dispenser that the rolls come in in the 3 roll pack are very basic.  The length of tape you get with the 3 roll pack is a lot shorter than a single roll, so if you have many gifts to wrap, then consider buying more of the single rolls.  Another reason you might like the single roll is because the serrated edge for the tape cutter is much more crude than a heavy desktop tape dispenser or even a regular plastic dispenser.

When the stress is perpendicular to the tape, it sometimes lifts. This is rarely the case when gift-wrapping. I think it is slightly less tacky than general-purpose tape. Sometimes you can lift it off if you make a mistake, but gift-wrap paper tends to be unforgiving.

This three-pack of Scotch GiftWrap (the solid spelling is 3m\\'s) comes in a purple carton that offers its own review: \". . . . features a unique satin finish that disappears on most gift wrap papers. Makes your gifts look great! Easy to dispense and sticks securely.\"The first thing I noticed is that the purple starter strip on each roll of tape lines up at a different point. I managed to grab one and pull the tape across the inch long gap so I can scrape it across the jagged plastic teeth for severing it. Why do all tape dispensers have this long gap between the roll and the cutting surface? Invariably, the exposed tape picks up dust, lint, dirt, even small insects and then has to be discarded (and the extra size seems a wasteful use of extruded plastic). Plus I tend to leave a fingerprint on the tape no matter how hard I try not to do so. 3M has a chance here to innovate instead of just replicate, but I\\'ll expect a cut from the production savings.Now in my tests, the unique satin finish actually disappears better (if there can be degrees of disappearance) on darker paper but shows up quite clearly on very light paper and on light areas of patterned gift paper. Are most gift wrap papers dark? I\\'m not sure 3M can substantiate its claim here.On to \"Makes your gifts look great!\" I have to take issue with the semantics. This tape is not going to be applied to most gifts, so it really does not affect how they look. I know that 3M means the wrapped gift, but honestly, nothing makes a wrapped gift for me look that good. I\\'ve never mastered the folding and sizing of the wrapping paper, and it is a running joke in my family that my skills in this area are marginal at best.But this extra-wide tape does make it easier to seal gift wrapping, whether one folds the paper with the precision of an origami expert or needs to span a revealing gap where the ends of the paper do not quite meet.Except for the inevitable fingerprints and occasional insect carcass, this tape is pretty easy to dispense until it detaches from the front of the dispenser, reattaches to the roll along an invisible seam, and triggers a torrent of cursing. It does stick securely as long as adults, not toddlers or cats, tug on the seams.Here is another point that may matter in some situations: this tape shares a quality with Silly Putty: it will lift ink from newsprint and from documents printed on inkjet printers, and sometimes it transfers that ink to other surfaces.When all is said and done it\\'s good to have a few rolls of this tape handy, and I\\'m sure we will run through a couple of rolls during the flurry of gift giving that occurs throughout November and December--several family members had birthdays and of course there is Christmas (sometimes lamely called \"The Holidays\" as if these were the only holidays over the course of a year).',\n",

Now, there is a specialized GiftWrap tape, which \"features a unique satin finish that disappears on most gift wrap papers\", according to Scotch. GiftWrap tape is a little stronger than Magic Tape and harder to tear. Its finish doesn\\'t have the dulling effect of the very-matte Magic Tape, but it is more reflective, which can be an issue in oblique light.I compared GiftWrap tape to Magic Tape on 6 different wrapping papers in a variety of lighting conditions. The papers were: gold metallic, silver patterned metallic, red, a bright print, a pastel print, and plain white paper. Magic Tape has always looked bad on metallics due to its matte texture that contrasts with the shiny paper. GiftWrap tape does much better. It can be noticeable in oblique light, but it is still a lot better than the Magic Tape on metallic papers. I observed much the same result on dark-colored papers.Light colors and prints produced varied results, however. The lighter the color, the greater the edge to the matte Magic Tape. The more reflective surface of the GiftWrap tape makes it more noticeable, especially if the light strikes your package from the side. On white paper, the Magic Tape is consistently less conspicuous than the GiftWrap tape. On the pastel print, Magic Tape is generally preferable. The brighter or darker the paper, the greater advantage to the more transparent GiftWrap tape over the dulling matte finish of Magic Tape.So there you have it. If you use a lot of metallic papers, get some GiftWrap tape. You\\'ll love the result. It also looks better on red paper, bright or dark prints, and probably -though I didn\\'t try it- on bright blue paper such as one might like for Hanukkah. If you use a lot of pastels or light prints, or your tastes in gift wrap are eclectic, you may not want to abandon your Magic Tape just yet. Keep both GiftWrap Tape and Magic Tape on hand. The GiftWrap tape is available in packages of 3 rolls, 300 inches each. The tape is 3/4 inch wide, same as the Magic Tape.',\n",
